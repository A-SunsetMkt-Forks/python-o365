# python-o365
A simple python library for interaction with Office 365. Read, create, send emails and calendar events. 

This library is still in development, but is a functional alpha. I have already used it to create systems for checking my facility's vehicle's calendars and forwarding emails to our printers. I hope to have it more stable, usable, and featured in the future.

Road Map:
0.5:
  * documentation
  * upload to pypi
  * usability additions
  * clean up. 

0.6
  * increase robustness
  * add unit tests

0.7
  * add support for the contacts api.
  * features!



# To the King!
