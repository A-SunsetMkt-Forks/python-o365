# python-o365
A simple python library for interaction with Office 365. Read, create, send emails and calendar events. 

This library is still in development, but is a functional alpha. I have already used it to create systems for checking my facility's vehicle's calendars and forwarding emails to our printers. I hope to have it more stable, usable, and featured in the future.

This library is still in development, but is already fairly functional. Suggestions and ideas are quite welcome.


# To the King!
